## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r BEACH DATA}
summary(cars)
```

``` {r not cars but beach data}
beach <- read.csv("C:/Users/johnm/OneDrive/Desktop/PINC 2025/PSP 2025/SCIP Materials/beach_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
summary(beach)
```

``` {r}
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo= TRUE}
barplot(beach$Weight,
        main = "Animal Weights",
        ylab = "Weiht (g)",
        names.arg = beach$Sample,
        las = 2,            #makes labels vertical for readability
        col = "red")

```
## weight standard deviation
``` {r}
sd(beach$Weight)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
